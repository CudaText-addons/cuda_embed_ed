Plugin for CudaText.

Shows documents in an embedded editor. 

For example '.js' and '.css' files in HTML.


Searches for a relative path between quotation marks (") in caret's position.

So if file is opened: 
    "/folder/file.html" 
    
 and an embedded editor is opened in `href` value in text:
    <link href="css/style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
    
 following file will be shown:
    "/folder/css/style.css"
